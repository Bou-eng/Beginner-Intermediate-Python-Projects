# Beginner-Intermediate-Python-Projects
This folder contains some projects that I have created when I started learning Python from the first day.
It contains some projects that are a beginner and intermediate level ones.
There are some different libraries used in these projects like Turtle, Tkinter, SMTP and Requests for APIs
You can enjoy them and if you are a new programming student you can take some bright ideas from them or even take them and improving them as you wish.
